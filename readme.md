# AVR Firmware Uploader

December 01 2023 - v1.0.3

Yes, it's just a simple GUI for avrdude and ESP32tool.

It is based on https://github.com/maddsua/arduinouploader

Features:
- Upload firmware files by just defining your Arduino Board and selecting the firmware file
- Sometimes the ProMicro gets a time out from AVRDude. In this case just start again flashing
- ESP32 must **not** be in bootloader mode for now

## Erase EEPROM
For the above mentioned boards also an erase EEPROM .hex file is included.
