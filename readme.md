# AVR Firmware Uploader

March 26 2025 - v1.1.1

Yes, it's just a simple GUI for avrdude and ESP32tool.

It is based on https://github.com/maddsua/arduinouploader

Features:
- Upload firmware files by just defining your Arduino Board and selecting the firmware file
- Sometimes the ProMicro gets a time out from AVRDude. In this case just start again flashing
- ESP32 must **not** be in bootloader mode for now
- Pico must **not** be in bootloader mode for now

- ProMicro
- Uno
- Nano (with old and new bootloader)
- Mini
- Pro/Mini (with separate USB adapter)
- ESP32-S2/S3
- Raspberry Pico (should work with all variants)

## Erase EEPROM

For the above mentioned boards also an erase EEPROM .hex file is included.
Choose the file according your board.
If you upload this firmware, the existing firmware and the eeprom content will be erased.
Afterwords upload your firmware file again.

With version 1.0.2 of the EEPROM clear hex files the build in LED of the Arduinos will blink after clearing the EEPROM

## Dump EEPROM

For the above mentioned boards also a dump EEPROM .hex file is included.
Choose the file according your board.
If you upload this firmware, the existing firmware will be erased but the EEPROM content will not be changed.
Afterwords upload your firmware file again.

## Terminal

A terminal program is included to communicate with the board via a serial connection. This can be used also for boards which are not listed above but the Mobiflight firmware is running on.
